                <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                <p>I am a geographer(and health enthusiast) who is interested in how we talk about health, how we map health, and how we visualize health. I combine geographic information systems(GIS), data science, visualization with public health methodology in better understand the relationships with health and various phenomena across physical and virtual spaces. In addition, I also combine public health and GIS models in order to create innovative mobile and web apps for health interventions.</p>
                <p>In addition, I provide training and consultation on how to integrate spatial analysis and geographic data science into health related research projects. I also have a background in instructional design and instructional technology and can create custom modules and educational materials to suit your or your organization's needs.</p>

In addition, I have used my instructional design experience in order to create learning materials such as tutorials to show how to do basic data collection using R.

                <p>This project was a final project in a class on health interventions and will be incorporated in my dissertation which is on using traditional and non-traditional data sources to better understand the quality of care the Veteran Affair's hospitals provide their patients. This project is based on the stand-alone mass media campaign intervention defined in the Guide to Community Preventative Services(The Community Guide) which was created by the Community Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts appointment by the Center for Diease Control (CDC) to give an evidenced-based review on various health interventions. The purpose of this project was to design an tech-based intervention to increase the physical activity of female veterans. A logic model and SMART objectives were created for this intervention. </p>

Machine learning algorithms categorized the tweets based on sentiment and political candidate. In addition, geostatistical techniques were conducted on the tweets to determine if there is a clustering of tweets.</p>
