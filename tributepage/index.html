            <p> Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja(B.K.S.) Iyengar is one of the most influential yoga teachers of all time. Dubbed such names as "the Michelangelo of Yoga” and the “king of yogis,” Iyengar was credited for bringing yoga to the West (Iyengar Yoga National Association of the U.S para 1, 2017). B.K.S. Iyengar was born on December 14, 1918 in Bellur, India (Ramanani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, n.a.; Busia, 2010).  Mr. Iyengar suffered much adversities in his youth such as suffering from poverty, sickness and the death of his father at the age of eight and a half years old (Busia, 2010). In 1934, when Mr. Iyengar was 16, he was sent to study yoga with his brother-in-law, Krishnamacharya (Goldberg, 2014). Krishnamacharya is considered one of the key figures in the revival of the physical practice of yoga, hatha yoga (Mohan, n.d.). Training with Krishnamacharya was extremely demanding for Iyengar and eventually, Krishnamacharya sent him to teach yoga in the gyms and colleges in Pune (Goldberg, 2014). Mr. Iyengar started to use props in order to ensure proper alignment and to prevent injury (Goldberg, 2014). This emphasis on alignment and the use of props would soon become the defining characteristics of Iyengar Yoga.</p>

                <p>Mr. Iyengar did not receive instant fame when he started to teach yoga.  He had language barriers and he barely scraped a living off teaching yoga (Busia, 2010). Despite this, he stayed dedicated to teaching and keeping a strong practice (Busia, 2010). Gradually, his hard work paid off and word spread about Mr. Iyengar which resulted in more teaching opportunities (Busia, 2010).  Mr. Iyengar’s teachings were exposed to the West due to his friendship with the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who he met in 1952 (Goldberg, 2014). Menuhin was inspired by Iyengar’s teachings and believed that doing yoga improved his violin playing (Goldberg 2014; Mortimer, 2015).  Not only did Yehudi invite Mr. Iyengar to Switzerland in 1954, he also introduced him to the Standard Oil Heiress Rebekah Harkness in 1956(Goldberg, 2014, Mortimer, 2015). Mr. Iyengar’s popularity started to spread among the rich and famous such as Aldous Huxley and Queen Elisabeth(Busia, 2010; Mortimer, 2015). </p>

He is preceeded by his daughter, Geeta, and his son, Prashant, who were trained by their father and carry on his teachings.  Mr. Iyengar also has a grand daughter, Abhijata who he also trained and is teaching at RIMYI.</p>

                <p>Iyengar yoga is considered to be "meditation in motion" in which one focuses both on fine tuning the body and mind    through performing asanas, the physical exercises of yoga.  Great attention is paid upon detail and alignment, and 
                   props such as blanket, straps and blocks are commonly used in order to insure not only alignment, but accessibility of the poses to all types of students. Because of this, Iyengar yoga is recognized as a style of yoga that can be used as treatment for serious medical conditions(IYANUS, 2017) Another main component of Iyengar yoga is pranayama, which are breathing exercises. While asanas might seem "more advanced" than pranayama, the practice of pranayama is done by intermediate and advanced practioners of Iyengar yoga. The practice of pranayama is usually not recommended until after a year of doing asanas.
